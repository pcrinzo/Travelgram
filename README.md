# Travelgram
Landing page based on Instagram


V.1.1

:bulb: This project is based on a challenge for a Bootcamp, where we had to create a copy of the Instagram landing page. 
I decided not only to copy it, but to imagine an Instagram where no face images are allowed, 
but only images of things that were part of a trip, the travelgram.
